# Database - Prisma
I saw a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHTA143_b-s) where they used
Prisma. I'm new to it, but liked it so far that I will opt for Prisma. The default
database framework that Nest writes in their documentation is `TypeORM`.

## Configuration


## Commands

`yarn prisma --help` 

For all important commands.
